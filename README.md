# 🧠 **Memory Allocation Simulator**

🚀 **A dynamic tool to simulate and understand memory allocation techniques!**

---

## 📜 **Overview**

The **Memory Allocation Simulator** models the memory management techniques used in operating systems. By implementing popular allocation strategies like **First Fit**, **Best Fit**, and **Worst Fit**, it helps visualize how processes are allocated memory blocks dynamically. Features like **Fragmentation Handling** and **Process Deallocation** make it a complete educational tool for understanding memory usage and efficiency.

## ✨ **Features**

✅ **Dynamic Memory Allocation Algorithms**  
- 🥇 **First Fit**: Allocates the first block that fits.  
- 🥈 **Best Fit**: Finds the smallest suitable block to minimize wasted space.  
- 🥉 **Worst Fit**: Allocates the largest block available to maximize fragmentation.  

✅ **Fragmentation Handling**  
- 🧩 Tracks **internal fragmentation** (unused space inside blocks).  
- 🧩 Tracks **external fragmentation** (scattered free blocks).  
- 📊 Displays real-time fragmentation statistics.  

✅ **Process Deallocation**  
- 🗑️ Frees up memory by process ID.  
- 🔄 Dynamically updates memory and fragmentation details.  

✅ **Interactive Console Interface**  
- 🎮 Easy-to-use command-based interface.  
- 📜 Provides structured, clear outputs for memory status and fragmentation.
